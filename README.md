# Vaccine Android Application Project

I made this project as a required task for college assignment. This project contains 
android studio project for demonstrating authentication and CRUD user data on mobile 
vaccine application. The application is connected to my Firebase realtime database. 
There also light mode and dark mode options available in this app.
