# Vaccine Android Application Project

I made this project as required task for college assignment. This project contains 
android studio project for demonstrating authentication, create, read, update and delete
user data on vaccine mobile application. The application is connected to my Firebase 
realtime database and i disable to delete the data from remote platform.

This project may lack of many use besides the CRUD function, reviews and suggestions 
is much expected 🙏
